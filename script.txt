Hi. I build systems that mostly behave.
If it broke, it was DNS.
If it wasn’t DNS, it was still DNS.

rob@robmaye:~$ cat todo.txt
[ ] fix one tiny thing
[ ] accidentally refactor everything
[ ] pretend it was planned

rob@robmaye:~$ about
I like clean architecture, ugly truths, and logs with timestamps.
I dislike: vague tickets, mystery requirements, and "can we hop on a quick call".

rob@robmaye:~$ skills
C#        : yes
SQL       : yes (and I will judge your indexes)
Python    : yes (but I’ll still make it a CLI)
Docker    : yes
CSS       : I know enough to be dangerous

rob@robmaye:~$ joke
There are 10 types of people:
those who understand binary, and those who also understand that this joke is ancient.

rob@robmaye:~$ fortune
You will fix the bug by adding one line.
Later you will discover what that line actually did.

rob@robmaye:~$ contact
email: rob@robmaye.me
github: click the icon like a normal person
linkedin: if you must

rob@robmaye:~$ clear

Are you sure? (y/N) y
Are you really sure? (y/N) y
Ok. Last chance. Type YES to continue: YES
